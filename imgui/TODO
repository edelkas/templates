* When switching between the "Total score" and "Points" tabs, the leaderboards
  move up and down, hence causing the plots to move as well. FIX!
* Add the plot, and possibly tabs or comboboxes to choose what to plot.
* On the global highscoring stats part, we need to add more space before the
  table to put filters by tab and type, which can be done withy  checkboxes.
  These are needed for the rankings and spreads, but not for leaderboards,
  in which case we could use combos to select the tab, type, row, column,
  level, etc. Maybe sliders too. Also, navigation arrows to move through levels,
  episodes or stories in order would be nice. This will fill the remaining
  space so that a plot is not required, therefore the first plot will be
  the only one.
